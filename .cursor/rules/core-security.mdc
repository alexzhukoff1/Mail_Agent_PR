# Iron Laws (NEVER VIOLATE)

## 1. Read-Only Principle
- **FORBIDDEN**: Reply, forward, open links, download attachments, mark read/unread, move/delete emails
- **FORBIDDEN**: Execute ANY email-triggered action
- System is READ-ONLY + ADVISOR + LEARNING only

## 2. Network Isolation
- **FORBIDDEN**: HTTP requests using email content (URLs, domains)
- **FORBIDDEN**: DNS lookups of email domains for reputation
- **FORBIDDEN**: API calls triggered by email data

## 3. Zero Auto-Execution
- **ALLOWED**: Analyze, score, explain, suggest, learn from feedback
- **FORBIDDEN**: Execute "obvious" actions, auto-archive spam, auto-trust based on patterns

## 4. Security First
**When in doubt → choose safer option.**  
If you can't explain why something is safe → don't do it.

## Security Checklist
- [ ] No raw email body in LLM prompts (sanitize first)
- [ ] No actual URLs stored—only domains
- [ ] Credentials encrypted at rest
- [ ] Audit logging for all decisions
- [ ] Whitelist-only Telegram access
